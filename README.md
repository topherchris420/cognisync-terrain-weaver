# Vers3Dynamics - Cognisync Platform

**Cognisync** is a cognitive terrain mapping and psychoenergetic influence platform. Built for advanced strategic simulation, resonance analytics, and symbolic operations, Cognisync-Ω renders real-time psychospatial landscapes derived from biometric, linguistic, geospatial, and subconscious input streams.

## 🧠 Core Functionality

Cognisync-Ω ingests multi-modal data—natural language, EEG/HRV telemetry, geo-tagged signal patterns—and converts them into structured **chrono-spatial displacement vectors**. These vectors are processed through the **Dynamic Resonance Rooting (DRR)** engine, which identifies and tracks evolving **resonance roots** across cultural, ideological, and symbolic domains.

The app visualizes this data as a **Holographic Resonance Atlas**, mapping collective belief morphologies, memetic drift fields, and destabilization corridors in real time.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 4D Cognitive Terrain Visualizer
Real-time rendering of belief fields, narrative clusters, and emotional topology with interactive particle systems

### 🔮 Dynamic Resonance Rooting (DRR) Phase Kernel
Detects resonance roots, bifurcation points, and coherence collapse structures using advanced algorithms

### 🛡️ Counter-Resonance Synthesizer
Neutralizes destabilizing meme clusters through adaptive symbolic payloads

### 💭 Dream-State Capture Layer
Integrates REM-phase biometric telemetry to forecast latent ideological emergence

### 🌐 Quantum-Entangled Edge Mesh

- Enables advanced threat detection capabilities
- Activates counter-resonance synthesis protocols

### Data Ingestion
- Configure multi-modal data streams in the left panel
- Monitor ingestion rates and stream health
- Adjust parameters for optimal cognitive mapping

### Resonance Analysis
- Track dynamic resonance patterns in real-time
- Monitor stability anchors and drift rates
- Analyze coherence levels across belief systems

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
VITE_SECURE_MODE_ENABLED=true
VITE_STRATEGIC_ACCESS_LEVEL=CLASSIFIED
VITE_DRR_ENGINE_VERSION=3.2.1
```

### Customization
